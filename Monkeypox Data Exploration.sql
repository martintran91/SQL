-- Let's look at symptoms
-- The symptoms reported are not in a standardized format and not all Sx may be correlated to monkeypox specifically, 
-- so for the purpose of keeping the dashboard in a standard format, I am using the list of Sx provided by the CDC
-- (https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html) which includes:
-- Fever
-- Headache
-- Muscle aches and backache
-- Swollen lymph nodes
-- Chills
-- Exhaustion
-- Respiratory symptoms (e.g. sore throat, nasal congestion, or cough)
-- A rash that may be located on or near the genitals (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anus (butthole) 
--    but could also be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth.
--        The rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing.
--        The rash can look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy.
