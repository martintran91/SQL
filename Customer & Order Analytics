#In this SQL, I'm using SQLiteStudio to query a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT cust.acctnum
FROM customers cust
JOIN FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM((quantity*price)) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, Quantity*(price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(feb.quantity)*price AS avg_spent
FROM customers cust
JOIN FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
SELECT location, COUNT(orderID) AS orders
FROM JanSales
WHERE location like '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3;

#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT distinct Product, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
FROM FebSales
WHERE product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT SUM((feb.quantity)*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS avg_spent_per_acct
FROM customers cust
JOIN FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID;

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(feb.Quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS avg_quant_per_acct
FROM customers cust
JOIN FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID;

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January, and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY revenue DESC
