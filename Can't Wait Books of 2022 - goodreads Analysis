# For this project, I used kaggle to download data that consisted of a curated list of most awaited books of 2022 from goodreads.
# I used MS Excel to clean the data to prepare it for querying.
# I then created a table into which I inserted the data.
# Finally, I analyzed the data using SQL. 

# Creating the table:

CREATE TABLE CantWaitBooks2022 (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
BookName VARCHAR NOT NULL,
AuthorName text NOT NULL,
AverageRating INTEGER NOT NULL,
RatingCount INTEGER NOT NULL,
Score INTEGER NOT NULL,
TotalPeopleVoted INTEGER NOT NULL
);

# Then I inserted the Can't Wait Books of 2022 Data .csv into the table.

# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

# First, I determined the 50 most awaited books of 2022 according to goodreads ratings.

SELECT BookName, AuthorName, AverageRating
FROM CantWaitBooks2022
ORDER BY AverageRating DESC
LIMIT 50;

# Next, I wanted to see which authors had the most books on the list.
# I used this to determine not only the most awaiting books, 
# but also authors that may be popular this year based off of the data.

SELECT AuthorName, COUNT(AuthorName) AS num_of_books
FROM CantWaitBooks2022
GROUP BY AuthorName
HAVING num_of_books > 1
ORDER BY num_of_books DESC;

# Finally, I determined which books readers may have been most excited for based on
# the number of ratings assuming that the number of ratings is the same as the number
# of times the book was read.

SELECT BookName, RatingCount
FROM CantWaitBooks2022
ORDER BY RatingCount DESC
LIMIT 25;
