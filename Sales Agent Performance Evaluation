#The following data was downloaded from a BreakIntoTech DataAnalytics course.
#In the following data exploration, we can look at performance of the employees. 
#In particular, we can observe how the support of each SSA contributed to sales.
#This data can be considered in conjunction with company/store goals (revenue) to determine effectiveness of the general manager and SSA.
#The analysis can be used by the GM to determine action plans for SSA.
